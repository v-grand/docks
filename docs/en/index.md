# Platform Overview

Welcome to our project documentation! This platform is a comprehensive solution for developing, deploying, and managing microservices.

## Key Components

The platform consists of several key components, each in its own repository and managed as a submodule:

-   **Services**: Core business applications (`auth`, `api`, `frontend`).
-   **Infrastructure**: Terraform modules and configurations for cloud providers (`infra-aws`, `infra-gcp`).
-   **Templates**: Standardized templates for quickly creating new components.

For more details on templates, see the [Templates](templates.md) section.
